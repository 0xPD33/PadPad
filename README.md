# PadPad

PadPad is my own, minimalistic and lightweight text editor.

The application is completely written in .NET C# Windows Forms.

Once I know some WPF, I'll probably rewrite it. 

Current Features:

- Write text (obviously)
- Make a new file
- Open and save files (no format currently)
- Print
- Very basic Undo and Redo (need to work on that)
- Cut, Copy and Paste
- Select All

Features that don't work yet, but are planned:
- Inserting tables/spreadsheets and pictures
- Search and find text
- Customize Font, etc.
- Options

Help appreciated :)
